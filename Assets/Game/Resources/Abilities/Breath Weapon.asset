  description: 'You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic
    ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

    When
    you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must
    make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry.
    The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency
    bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage
    on a successful one.'
  damageDie:
    count: 2
